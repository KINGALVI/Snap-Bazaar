## 📖 Project Description

Snap Bazaar is designed to showcase beginner-to-intermediate front-end development skills with a focus on user experience polish. It features reusable components, dynamic state management using Context API, and delightful UI feedback through animations and modals.

This project was built as part of a portfolio to demonstrate real-world e-commerce logic, including inventory tracking, discount handling, and login-based order placement. It uses a local JSON file as the product database and includes thoughtful touches like tooltips, search filtering, and responsive design.
